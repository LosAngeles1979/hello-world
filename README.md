# hello-world
Just a practice github project
This is my first edit of the readme file.  
I made the edit in the readme-edits branch.
This edit was made within Visual Studio Code
on my local branch!

I made this change on my home computer and pushed it up!
I made this change on github in a browser. I will try to pull it down to my home computer.
It worked! I was able to pull it down.
To delete my local branch I just removed the entire directory (all files, .get folder, etc.)

**I hope this was the right thing to do!**

Looks OK, I re-cloned to another directory on my home computer.
Made this change, pushed it up.  S'awright!
